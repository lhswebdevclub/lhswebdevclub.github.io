    <h1>ABOUT_US</h1>
    <p>After learning how to program mostly on our own, we were slightly disappointed by our school’s lack of front-end development opportunities both for experienced and beginner programmers. By teaching lessons, hosting challenges, and connecting our school’s aspiring front end developers with those in need of websites, we strive to close this gap in our school’s learning environment.
